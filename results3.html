    you to everybody who answered our Issue 3 Survey on Short Tail Disease.<br>

    <p align="center"><font color="#000000">In this survey we tried to determine the spread of
    this disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;'Short Tail Disease' is when some birds never grow their main
    primary tail feathers and others during their first moult drop these feathers and never
    regrow them.</font></p>

    <p align="center"><b><u><font size="+2">THE RESULTS</font></u></b></p>
    <p align="center">We had 16 replies to this survey, and out of these there where 2555
    Budgerigars breed, and 26 of these had developed Short Tail Disease, this meant that:</p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+1"><i><b>FOR EVERY 170 BIRDS BREAD, THERE IS A POSSIBILITY
    THAT 2 OF THEM WILL DEVELOP SHORT TAIL</b></i></font><em><strong><font size="2"> </font><big>DISEASE</big></strong></em></p>
    <p align="center">We also asked if people believed that this disease was linked to French
    Moult.<br>
    Here are the results:<br>
    <strong>YES - 7 Responses<br>
    NO - 6 Responses<br>
    MAYBE - 3 Responses</strong></p>
    <p align="center"><u><b><i>Here are some interesting comments we received from this
    survey:</i></b></u></p>
    <p align="left">[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I personally believe it is a mild form of French
    Moult which only affects the bird in the tail area.</p>
    <p align="left">[2]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The one and only short tail bird I've produced came
    from a bird I bought which had excellent qualities yet had a short tail.</p>
    <p align="left">[3]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We call it &quot;feather cysting&quot;.Often the
    feathers will keep growing in but drop out before fully developed and also appear withered
    as if feather was receiving inadequate blood supply for development.<br>
    Eventually area becomes cysted and feather no longer grows.Noticed mostly in buff-type
    birds.</p>
    <p align="left">[4]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually we got 2 birds with this disease, after 3
    years of breeding budgies, I think it has something to do with the french moult, cause in
    the clutch he was born, his brother developed the french moult, and when he moult his tail
    feathers never grew up. I really didn't know of this disease, I thought it was french
    moult.<br>
    I should said this two birds we got with short tails came after several years, first time.</p>
    <p align="left">[5]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Possibility of French moult link ie partial
    affectation. feathers seem to be weak. Have checked roots for stubs.</p>
    <p align="left">[6]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Yes, it could be 1 type of FM.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Could be damaged follicles, caused by
    extreme cold (like frostbite)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Could be hereditary.</p>
    <p align="left">[7]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease.suggest you
    contact Ross Perry. His research into PBFD suggests that they are related. Ross is a well
    known avian specialist. Ross was the Vet. who named and realised that it was a virus and
    started all the research.</td>

    <p><font size="3"><strong>[1] </strong>- Naphthalene Flakes placed in tins with holes
    punched in them are a deterrent to mice and moths in aviaries and breeding rooms that are
    not mouse proof.&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember to shake the tin daily.</p>
    <p><strong>[2]</strong> - Metal aviaries should be hosed down on days of high temperature
    -&nbsp; this will ensure birds do not get overheated and stressed.</p>
    <p><strong>[3]</strong> - When designing a new aviary try to ensure it is constructed to
    allow a flow of ventilation through the whole complex.&nbsp; This will keep the aviary
    cool and reduce dust.</p>
    <p><strong>[4]</strong> - It is well worth it to put a 'Spinaway Ventilator' in the roof
    of the breeding room - as it&nbsp; helps in ensuring good ventilation and assists in
    removing dust, etc.</p>
    <p><strong>[5]</strong> - Before and after sweeping out breeding rooms always sprinkle a
    bit of water around on the floor - it helps to cut down all dust.</p>

    <p><font size="3"><strong>[1] </strong>- As we all know budgerigars in the wild feed on
    seeding grasses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Try cutting wild grasses which are going to seed and feed
    them to your birds, they love them!</p>
    <p><strong>[2]</strong> - If you have surplus carrots in the garden or they are going to
    seed throw bunches of them into your aviary (with the dirt still on them), but make sure
    you don't do this around the show season.&nbsp;&nbsp; They will also demolish red beet,
    sweet corn, and cabbages.</p>
    <p><strong>[3]</strong> - Try putting gum tree branches in your aviary they will not only
    smell good, but the birds will have great fun chewing all the leaves and bark off, some
    also say the eucalyptus oil is a good for the birds.</p>
    <p><strong>[4]</strong> - We hear there is a new variety of oats available which by all
    reports is of good quality.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are called Bandicoot Oats.</p>
    <p><strong>[5]</strong> - Some parent birds will kick their young out of the nest well
    before they can crack seed for themselves , and if the cock bird does not feed these young
    you can crush sweet plain biscuits with a rolling pin.&nbsp; Mix with water until a thick
    paste, and then feed this to these young via a crop needle three to four times a day until
    you see them cracking seed.</p>

    <p><font size="3"><strong>[1] </strong>- Budgerigars lay every second day, usually between
    12 noon and 2 pm.</p>
    <p><strong>[2]</strong> - To check fertility of eggs use a fine tipped laser torch or
    similar, eggs will start to show colour on the sixth day of sitting.&nbsp; If an egg is
    fertile you will start to see red inside the egg (this is the baby bird forming), if the
    egg is empty the eggs colour will be clear.</p>
    <p><strong>[3]</strong> - Hens may not start to sit until the second or third egg is
    laid, so first egg may take twenty days to hatch.</p>
    <p><strong>[4]</strong> - We sometimes remove the first and second egg as laid and replace
    them when third egg is laid, this results in multiple hatchings on day 1.</p>
    <p><strong>[5]</strong> - If found within a couple of days after laying chipped eggs can
    be repaired successfully by patching with clear nail polish, ensure polish is dry before
    placing egg back under hen.</p>

    <p><font size="3"><strong>[1] </strong>- Start whilst birds are still in nest = give those
    with potential extra handling.</p>
    <p><strong>[2]</strong> - Introduce these birds to show cages immediately they leave the
    nest.</p>
    <p><strong>[3]</strong> - When birds are being show cage trained put them in an area of
    high human activity, this tends to help them settle down a lot quicker.</p>
    <p><strong>[4]</strong> - Check birds eight weeks prior to shows for damaged feathers,
    remove all broken or damaged feathers, remember it takes six to eight weeks for primary
    flight &amp; tail feathers to regrow to maturity.</p>
    <p><strong>[5]</strong> - Start a program of spraying the birds with tempered water
    immediately, one to two days a week building up to four to five days a week one week prior
    to show date.&nbsp; Cease spraying two days prior to show.</p>
    <p><strong>[6]</strong> - As mentioned in Issue Two tips de-spot the birds of surplus
    throat spots.&nbsp;&nbsp; I prefer cutting them as this enables the bird to be shown at
    many shows with only minor touch ups required in this area, depending how multi spotted
    the birds are dictates when the de-spotting should be undertaken.&nbsp; It can take two to
    five goes to get it right, we like to do it slowly placing the birds back in show cages
    after de-spotting to let the bird settle down so that we can check that we are removing
    the right spots.</p>
    <p><strong>[7]</strong> - Having done all this the rest is up to the birds. &quot;good
    luck&quot;</font></p>

    <p align="left"><b>[1]</b> - Feather Pluckers - When first noticed place an iodine bell,
    minus the wire, in the concave which the chicks, this will on most occasions stop the
    problem. <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    <b>[2]</b> - Budgerigars love bread of all types, try throwing your bread scraps onto the
    aviary floor, the birds love them. <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    <b>[3]</b> - Having trouble with mite in the breeding room?&nbsp; Hang a couple of pest
    strips in the room and this will ensure a mite free breeding season. <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    <b>[4]</b> - Egg Bound Hens - When first noticed <b>immediately</b> immerse the bird, up
    to the waist, into warm water, this tends to relax the bird and she will usually pass the
    egg virtually straight away, she must then be rested for at least two months. <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    <b>[5]</b> - Before pairing up your birds, try placing a couple of rotten logs of wood in
    with the hens, they take great delight in demolishing them and really gets them in the
    mood to go to nest. <br>

    <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><b>[1]</b> - Try feeding a chicken carcass to your
    birds in the flight [they will love them].</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>[2]</b> - For ease of operation during the breeding season
    attach a small piece of white board contact to each nest box and use a special white board
    pencil to record daily occurrences.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see a picture of a typical
    budgerigar breeding cage on the </font><a href="library.htm">

    <p><font color="#000000"><b>[3]</b> - Instead of plucking out surplus spots when dressing
    birds for shows, try cutting them with small scissors. By doing it this way, you will only
    need to dress the birds once per show season, as the bulk of the feather stays intact
    until a natural moult.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>[4]</b> - Having trouble with hens eating their eggs or the
    cocks throwing eggs out? Then try replacing the eggs with marbles, ' They will soon give
    up!'</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>[5]</b> - If you have tight sitting hens which can result in
    squashed chicks, put a large marble about three times the size of a normal egg in with
    their clutch. This will tend to keep the hen up off the chicks.</font> </td>

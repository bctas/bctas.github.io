    <font size="+2" color="#000000"><b>WHAT IS A FRENCH MOULTER?</b></font><br>
    <font color="#000000">Birds effected with French Moult can vary in degree of damage, most
    being affected in their primary and secondary flight and tail feathers <i>(as shown in the
    picture below)</i>, the recovery factor in governed by the degree of damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Most damage is caused to the quill of the feather, (the part of the feather that enters
    the bird).</font><br>

    <br>
    We had 25 replies to this survey, and out of these there where 2644 Budgerigars breed, and
    158 of these were French Moulters, this meant that:</p>

    <p align="center"><u><b><i>Here are some of the comments we received from this survey:</i></b></u>
    &nbsp; </p>
    <p><b><i>[1] </i></b>French moulters appear at the end of the breeding season and I
    believe are linked to a combination of factors including the following: <br>
    - The higher temperature (Australia) <br>
    - Stress from Birds at the end of the second round <br>
    - Longer daylight hours - not as much rest. </p>
    <p><b><i>[2] </i></b>No french moult in ten years or more, my father and my son have not
    had any in years, or ever in my son's case, don't think it is a problem like it was when
    we had it every year, maybe a genetic lack of resistance, as all my birds came from lines
    that had it but, none that showed it were used for breeding, only birds with no f.moult
    were used ,so year after year there was less and less, then there was none!!! </p>
    <p><b><i>[3] </i></b>The number of French Moulters I breed in a year seams to be dependent
    on a couple of things: </p>
    <p>A) whether or not I've brought in a large number of new birds (such as buying out
    someone else stud), at which I experience a large amount of french moult, around 75%. </p>
    <p>B) How long has it been since an attack.&nbsp; It appears my stud's resistance goes up
    and down, that is to say I can expect an attack every four years, at which point about 75%
    are affected. </p>
    <p align="left">This year I've had no french moult, but the last two years were bad, the
    first of the two being my time, and last due to the aquistion of a stud.<br>

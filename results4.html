    Egg Bound Hens.<br>

    <p align="left"><strong>[1]</strong>&nbsp; Hen will mostly be found out of 
	nest box fluffed up and swollen around vent area with tail pumping.<br>
    <strong>[2]</strong>&nbsp; Hen will be found with a prolapse, usually with 
	the egg still attached.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><u><font size="+2">THE RESULTS</font></u></b></p>
    <p align="center">We had 17 replies to this survey, and out of these there 
	where 454 Pairs of Budgerigars, and 16 of the hens in these pairs became Egg 
	Bound.</p>
    <p align="center">We also asked if people the age of the Egg Bound Hen<br>
    Here are the results:<br>
    <strong>Less than 1 year - 6 Hens<br>
    2 years - 5 Hens<br>
    3 years - 2 Hens</strong></p>
    <p align="center"><u><b><i>Here are some interesting comments we received 
	from this survey:</i></b></u></p>
    <p align="left">[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is not one I encounter 
	very often. It can occur with hens of any age. I find it normally happens 
	more frequently with hens that have been in cages too long before pairing 
	up.<br>
    If they are in flights, they must be active. It is no good if a hen is idle, 
	and stays in the same place all the time.<br>
    Cod liver oil soaked seed in the two months prior to breeding helps to 
	prevent the problem. (Do not soak too much at one time - it goes rancid, and 
	causes more problems).<br>
    To remove the egg, hold the bird over a bowl of hot water, and with a 
	child's paintbrush, paint the vent with an oil. Olive oil is very good. When 
	the egg is passed, return the hen to her original cage, but remove the cock. 
	Keep her quiet, and don't use her again that year.</p>
    <p align="left">[2]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 12 years of breeding budgies I have 
	never had an egg bound hen, I feed my hens on sunflower&nbsp; seed a little 
	over a period of time before breeding time</p>
    <p align="left">[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 tbl spoon of cod liver oil 1 tbl 
	spoon wheatgerm mix with 500grams of seed helps prevent egg binding.</p>
    <p align="left">[2]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I have 23 breeding pairs. Two of 
	my hens have become egg bound. They were at that time 8 months. So, I think 
	they were too young. But I want as many young birds as possible of this 
	hens, because they are really good.</p>
    <p align="left">[3]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 young hen egg bound this season, 
	first time for a number of seasons.</p>
    <p align="left">[4]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I paired up 1 pair of breeding budgies 
	a year. Only one hen became egg bound. The hen was about a year old, she is 
	on her second clutch and became egg bound again. Each time it was the last 
	egg. The second pair hasn't given any results yet.</td>

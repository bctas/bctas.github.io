						<p align="left">Budgerigars also known as Melopsittacus Undulatus, are native to the country of Australia
    and are found in the wild in Western, Central, North Western, and South Australia and also
    in New South Wales and Queensland, but are absent in the state of Tasmania. In the wild
    the Budgerigar is only found in one variety, which is the Light Green Normal variety. <br>
    The name Budgerigar comes from a Aboriginal term which when translated means 'good bird,'
    or 'good food.' </p>

    <p ALIGN="left">This question has been asked many times. Here are what we believe to be
    the benefits of joining your local Club or Society.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><strong>1</strong>. Most clubs are run by people with the same interest as
    your.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><strong>2</strong>. Free Information is available for e.g:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [a] birdkeeping information and tips<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [b] feeding<br>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>3</strong>. Clubs have a wealth of information which has been
    passed down over the years and many breeders are keen to share with new members.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>4</strong>. It also enables you to purchase quality bloodlines
    which are proven winners at the time. Top breeders are more inclined to sell surplus birds
    from their good stock to club members.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>5</strong>. Enables you to start exhibiting your birds at
    shows. This is the quickest path to improving your stock, as you constantly are having
    your birds compared to others.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>6</strong>. Become an Office Bearer - for those willing to do
    so over many years we have found this to be very beneficial as you are always at the
    forefront of the hobby and part of the decision making processes.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>7</strong>. All clubs have judges training courses which can
    lead eventually to becoming state/national accredited judges.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>8</strong>. Friendship - many lifelong friendships have had
    their beginnings at a local bird club meeting.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As you can see we have only just touched on the subject, so why not
    seek out and join your local club and become part of a world wide hobby of breeding
    Budgerigars.</p>

    <p class="style1"><font size="+2"><a name="feeding_wild"></a>Breeding and Feeding in the Wild</font></p>
						<p>In the wild the Budgerigars breeding habits are dictated by nature. By this we mean they
    only breed when feed is plentiful. Whole breeding colonies of thousands of birds have been
    known to abandon their nest comprising both eggs and young and move to a new location
    because their food supply has been exhausted. The wild budgerigars feed exclusively on
    seeding grasses. If drought conditions exist or bush fires destroy the feeding grounds the
    flock will move on to another location and start again, this results in the loss of many
    thousands of young birds. The birds usually nest in what is known as Mallee (Eucalyptus or
    as they are better known 'Gum Trees'). They seek out every hollow that is to be found and
    some large hollows can have up to five breeding pairs in them, each pair usually lay four
    to five eggs per clutch. </p>
						<hr>
    <p><a name="feeding show"></a><span class="style1"><font size="+2">Breeding and Feeding for Exhibition</font></span></p>
						<p>Breeding in captivity is not very difficult but it can be testing at times. This I believe
    is because we have changed the domesticated bird dramatically from that found in the wild.
    In our endeavour to breed the champion bird for exhibition we have changed the structure
    of the bird. The birds are now much larger in size ( 225 mm for exhibition birds compared
    to 192 mm in the wild). Their feathering has been lengthened and encouraged to grow in
    what is called directional feathering, this means the feathers do not follow the contour
    of the body as the do in the wild. This gives the appearance of a much bigger bird
    especially around the head area. This is not usually a problem with the cock budgerigar
    but in large hens it can be a major problem. </p>
						<p><i><font size="-1">(The changes to the domesticated bird are discussed in the next
    article.)</font></i> </p>
						<p>At the F1 Stud we feed a commercially produced seed mixtures comprising: Plain Canary Seed
    50%, White French Millet, Panicum, Jap Millet and Vitamins A, D3, and E all coated lightly
    with vegetable oil. To this we add small portions of Hulled Oats and Black Sunflower. The
    birds are given fresh Silver Beet every day. Carrots including tops, Apples, Sweetcorn
    cobs and wild seeding grasses, and especially chick weed are fed on a regular basis. When
    feeding young the breeding pairs are also given sprouted seeds comprising feed oats, black
    sunflower and mung beans every morning as well as soaked hulled oats. Chicken carcasses
    are thrown into the aviaries - the birds love them so much that they demolish all but the
    large bones. </p>
						<hr>
    <p><a name="change"></a><span class="style1"><font size="+2">Changes in the Domesticated Budgerigar</font></span> </p>
						<p>As mentioned in Issue 1 the structure of the bird has changed dramatically over the last
    fifty years since fanciers around the world have been breeding this fantastic little bird.
    We have seen an increase in length by 33 mm as well as the body structure which has
    increased to the extent that the modern exhibition Budgerigar is now twice the width of
    the wild specimen.&nbsp;&nbsp; The changes don't stop there because the length of feather
    has also increased and the amount of underdown has thickened substantially. </p>
						<p>This is all well and good for exhibiting of birds, as these changes are very pleasing to
    the eye and with the overall standard around the world getting closer
    together.&nbsp;&nbsp; But with these changes we have seen problems developing in breeding,
    not so much with the big bold cock birds, but with the beautiful big hen birds, we have
    found that the best way to use these hens for breeding is when they are at about 6 months
    of age. If you can get more than one season out of them [count it as a bonus] as after 6
    months you may have trouble getting any chicks from her. </p>
						<p>Other problems that have surfaced because of these structural changes. These being
    feathers growing on the legs and feet, more weepy eye problems and the birds flight
    pattern is changing because of the amount of head feathering. Some birds have difficulty
    in seeing straight ahead without tilting their head from side to side, which in turn
    causes their flight pattern to alter. Although I am sure that none of us would go back in
    time, our challenge remains to try and get all varieties up to the one standard and of
    course to breed the elusive black or red budgerigar.</p>

	<font size="+2">Moving House with your Stud</font></span></p>
						<p>Moving from an existing well established Aviary [20 years old] to no aviary only a large
    tin shed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#145;How this was accomplished!&#146; <br>
    * With a Stud of approximately 200 Budgerigars and at the end of the Show Season with 2
    pairs still breeding. <br>
    * An extension was built onto an existing shed approx. 6 metres x 6 metres with concrete
    floor making it completely mouse proof. <br>
    * All cages were to come. <br>
    * Travel distance for moving was approximately ½ hour. <br>
    * Birds were transported in a specially designed Budgerigar travel cage with 40 separate
    small cages, which held 4 birds each and then folded together making the environment dark
    for travel. <br>
    * For the 2 pairs still breeding [with very new babies].&nbsp;&nbsp; The nest boxes were
    attached to 2 old show cages and transported [with both hens not even leaving the nest]
    and reattached to breeding cages at new residence. <br>
    * All birds were housed in training type cages within the tin shed. <br>
    * Building commenced &#150; all walls were lined and insulated [for the purpose to prevent
    cold in winter and against heat in summer.]. <br>
    * An indoor flight was built with plans for an extension of an outdoor flight to be
    attached and various other amenities to be added at a later date. <br>
    * Breeding cages have been set up and birds now have been paired ready for breeding. <br>
    * This has taken approximately 2 months and we look forward to a good breeding season in
    our new environment.</p>
						<hr>
    <p>&nbsp;<a name="new_en"></a><span class="style6">Breeding in a New Environment &#150; the Pitfalls and Advantages</span></p>
						<p><font size="3">Well, the breeding season is fast drawing to a close and this being a short
    season due to the moving and building of the breeding room etc. our numbers are down on
    past seasons, our season usually runs for six months, this one has been for only three
    months.</font></p>
    <font size="3"><p>The new environment has worked well even though it is not finished, the
    birds have adapted to the change with no significant failures apart from the normal ones
    of getting those birds of superior quality to breed. In retrospect if we had our time over
    again, we would try to move in the non breeding season, this would give the birds more
    time to settle in and become accustomed to the new housing and possibly come into their
    natural breeding condition. The good news is we have bred some Quality birds which after
    they moult should be competitive on the show bench, we will give an update on the
    youngsters in the next issue.</font></p>
    					<hr>
    <p ALIGN="left"><a name="basic_re"></a><strong><em><span class="style4">The Basic Requirements for your
    Budgerigar</span></em></strong></p>
						<p ALIGN="left"><strong>[1]</strong> <u><em>FOOD</em></u><br>
    A good quality Budgerigar Mix, ie a premium mix is desirable. Budgerigars will also
    appreciate seeds added to this diet such as hulled oats and sunflower seeds, in small
    quantities. when the bird moults [especially the first moult at 3 months of age], the
    extra oils and carbohydrates provided by these seeds assist with the growth of new
    feathers. At moulting time extra canary seed [for protein] is also desirable, as feathers
    are mostly protein and canary seeds being high in protein will help new growth. Remember
    to check seed is always available, and blow the seed husks off the dish.<br>
    <strong>[2]</strong> <em><u>WATER</u></em><br>
    A clean supply changed daily is required. Birds will also bathe if water is placed in a
    dish on the floor of the cage. Water helps new feathers grow, helping to soften pin
    feathers Water also assists in preening, keeping feathers clean and stimulating oil
    placement by the bird.<br>
    <strong>[3]</strong> <u><em>SHELL GRIT</em></u><b><br>
    </b>All birds require grit as they have no teeth. They use the grit to help crush seed in
    the digestive process. A regular supply is necessary. Beach sand, shell grit, fine river
    gravel must be clean. Give a varied supply from different sources. Grit is available at
    pet shops.<br>
    <strong>[4]</strong> <em><u>CALCIUM SUPPLY</u></em><b><br>
    </b>Cuttle fish bone should always be available to your bird.&nbsp; If this is unavailable
    calcium bells are easily obtained from pet shops.<br>
    <strong>[5]</strong> <u><em>EXTRAS</em></u><br>
    [i] Silver beet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ii] Carrot
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; [iii] apple<br>
    [iv] bread &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [v] chicken
    bones&nbsp; [vi] wild seeding grasses<br>
    <strong>[6]</strong> <u><em>EXERCISE</em></u><b><br>
    </b>Your bird should be allowed to fly once a day if possible. The cage should have enough
    space for the birds to be able to fly or hover. Do not clutter the cage with toys.<br>
    <strong>[7]</strong> <u><em>SUNSHINE</em></u><br>
    Provide indirect light such as broken sunshine or partial sunlight to the bird cage. Do
    not cook the bird by leaving it in full sunshine either inside or out.&nbsp; Generally
    where you would be comfortable applies to the bird.<br>
    <strong>[8] </strong><u><em>SECURITY</em></u><b><br>
    </b>Keep a peg on the door and make sure cats cannot knock the cage over. Keep an eye on
    your bird if placed outside.<br>
    <strong>[9] </strong><u><em>CLEANLINESS</em></u><b><br>
    </b>Clean the cage, perches, and dishes at regular intervals, e.g. every 1 or 2 weeks.<br>
    <b>[10] </b><u><em>DO NOT</em></u><b><br>
    </b>1. DO NOT keep the bird in a cold draughty place.<br>
    2. DO NOT let the bird fly with electrical items such as heaters or fans operating in your
    house. Also water is dangerous as the bird could drown, e.g. baths, sinks, etc. Pull
    curtains closed as birds may fly into the glass if they do not know the house or are
    frightened.<br>
    3. DO NOT purchase cane bird cages as budgies can eat them and get out.</p>

    <p><b>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; BIRDS - No favourites unless you are trying to breed or improve a
    certain variety.</b> </p>
    <p><b>[2]&nbsp;&nbsp; SHOW CAGES - Essential for assessing birds at any time.</b> </p>
    <p><b>[3]&nbsp;&nbsp; TRESTLES TO CARRY AT LEAST 8 CAGES - To get a fair assessment of

    <p><b>[5]&nbsp;&nbsp; TIME - Plenty of time because it is a slow process</b> </p>
    <p><b>[6]&nbsp;&nbsp; GOAL - Where is your pinnacle ? What do you want to achieve?</b> </p>
    <p><b>[7]&nbsp;&nbsp; COMMITMENT - Prepared to make the hard decisions that will be

    <p><a name="terms"></a><span class="style1"><font size="+2">Budgie Word 
	Glossary</font></span> </p>
						<p>Below is a list of few words used in reference to 
						Budgerigars and their meanings: </p>
    <p><strong><font size="3"><i>CERE</i></font><big> -</big></strong><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
    The section of a Budgerigar that is above the beak, the birds nostrils are also located
    here. [See <a href="#sexing the budgerigar">Sexing the Budgerigar</a>] </p>
    <p><b><font size="3"><i>RUNNER</i></font><big> -</big>&nbsp; </b>A Budgerigar suffering
    from French Moult. </p>
    <p><b><font size="3"><i>UNBROKEN CAP</i></font><big> </big>- </b>Is the name given to a
    Budgerigar under the age of 12 weeks (approx.) or until they commence their first
    moult.&nbsp;&nbsp; In most varieties it is easily identified by the barring across the
    head and the lack of an iris in the eye.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also known as UBC or Nest Feather. </p>
    <p><b><font size="3"><i>DIRECTIONAL FEATHER</i></font> - </b>Term used when describing the
    feather on a bird's head. Breeders today endeavour to breed their show birds with head
    feathers growing outwards away from the head, this type of feathering tends to give the
    impression that the bird has a large head. </p>
    <p><b><font size="3"><i>PINCHED, NARROW, HAWK EYED</i></font> - </b>Terms used to describe
    birds with no head size and lack of directional feathering. </p>
    <p><b><font size="3"><i>GOOD BLOW</i></font> - </b>Ability of a bird to puff their head
    feathering, again giving the impression that the bird has a larger head. </p>
    <p><b><font size="3"><i>HEAVY WINGS</i></font> - </b>Used to describe birds with large
    secondary flights, also birds with long primary flights that fan out and hang down instead
    of being tight and follow the contour of the body. </p>
    <p><b><font size="3"><i>LEG FEATHERS</i></font> - </b>In our endeavour to breed birds with
    more feather, we are now breeding them with feathers growing on the lower leg. This is
    unsightly to the eye and is regarded as a fault when showing, therefore, the feathers need
    to be removed by trimming with small scissors before exhibiting in shows. </p>
    <p><b><font size="3"><i>PENCIL SHAPE</i></font> - </b>Birds that are long and thin, with
    lack of shoulder. </p>
    <p><b><font size="3"><i>TYPE</i></font> - </b>Term used when describing general
    conformation, including balance, deportment, size and condition. Type is very important to
    those showing birds. </p>
    <p><b><i><font size="3">CLEFT MASK</font><font size="+1"> </font></i>- </b>Birds with this
    give the impression that the mask is split down the middle. </p>
    <p><b><font size="3"><i>GROUND COLOUR</i></font> - </b>This is the underlying colour,
    white in the blue series, yellow in the green series, upon which all other pigments and
    markings are superimposed. </p>
